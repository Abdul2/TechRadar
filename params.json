  "body": "# Tech Radar\r\n\r\nStatus : WIP\r\n\r\nWeb Application to enable community technology management within your organisation.\r\n\r\n* Add technologies that you are interested in and associate with categories and projects\r\n* Get your users to comment on the technologies they have experience in\r\n* Vote on whether they think they should be adopted, trialed or avoided.  \r\n* Users with the correct permissions can then set the 'offical' status with a rationale for each technology\r\n\r\n## Planned future features\r\n\r\n* Stack builder\r\n  * Associate a number of trechnologies into a 'stack' \r\n  * View reports/comments for each technology in one place\r\n  * Add comments on the 'stack' as a whole\r\n\r\n* Trending\r\n  * Show the status of technologies over time\r\n  * Status changes\r\n  * When did users vote and the status\r\n  * When did projects adopt\r\n\r\n* Supplier index\r\n * Which suppliers have we used and our verdict\r\n\r\n\r\n## Design\r\n\r\nTechRadar is a Web Application devleoped using NodeJS, Passport, Bootstrap and PostgreSQL.  \r\nIt consists of two layers:\r\n\r\n1. Web Layers \r\n2. API REST Services\r\n\r\nThe web application calls the API REST services using ajax.\r\n\r\n## Pre-requisites\r\n\r\n* NodeJS\r\n* PostgreSQL database (other databases are available and will probably work with small changes to the schema)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstallation is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Provision a node environment and PostgreSQL database\r\n2. Define the following environment variables; either by creating a process.env in the root directory or defining standard environment variables\r\n   * DATABASE_URL\r\n3. Deploy code to target environment\r\n4. Run 'database/dninit.js' to create all the required tables\r\n5. Run 'database/dbtestdata.js' to create some test data if required\r\n6. Run 'server.js' :)\r\n\r\nDeploying the code to your preferred NodeJS environment (personally I use OpenShift and Heroku)\r\n",
